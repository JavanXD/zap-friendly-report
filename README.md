# ZAP Proxy Friendly Report
A friendly ZAP Proxy Report converter from XML to HTML and Material Design.

# Status
Still in `Work In Progress` for now.

What's missing:
 * Finish the main form
 * Fix `dark` theme
 * Fix charts `style` issues

# Preview


> Pictures are subject to changes during the development. I will try to keep them updated.

# Charts
Charts are provided by an open-source project named [eCharts](https://echarts.apache.org).

## Themes
Charts themes are generated and downloaded from https://echarts.baidu.com/theme-builder/. Once downloaded, modify the following files:

 * `index.html`: Add a new `javascript` include line to the end of the file. (_next to the others already existing_)
 * `main.js`: Replace the defined `theme` names by the new one.
